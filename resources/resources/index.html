<h2 id="working-environment">Working Environment</h2>
<h3 id="it-support">IT Support</h3>
<p>When you need IT support, contact the College of Engineering's ITSG and not the University-wide IT Support Desk. Do so by filing a ticket <a href="https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/">here</a>. This applies to both campuses.</p>
<h3 id="facilities-support">Facilities Support</h3>
<p>When you need non-technical facilities support around campus, file a ticket with Facilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gates Hall or Rhodes Hall: file a ticket <a href="https://tdx.cornell.edu/TDClient/171/Portal/Home/">here</a>.</li>
<li>A different building overseen by the College of Engineering: file a ticket <a href="https://tdx.cornell.edu/TDClient/133/Portal/Home/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Cornell Tech facilities can be reached at <code>facilities@tech.cornell.edu</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-hidden-curriculum">The hidden curriculum</h2>
<h3 id="internal-resources">Internal resources</h3>
<p>Cornell Tech's Mor Naaman has drafted an excellent &quot;<a href="https://s.tech.cornell.edu/phd-syllabus/">PhD Syllabus</a>&quot; for students working in his group. Your mileage may vary, but this syllabus provides great insights into the PhD process.</p>
<h3 id="external-resources">External resources</h3>
<p>Check out the extensive reading recommendations provided by PhD professionalization seminars at other computer science departments. These resources span a range of topics, including the advisor-advisee relationship; imposter syndrome; academic speaking, writing, and reading skills; and time management during the PhD.</p>
<ul>
<li>Harvard's <a href="https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/readings/"><em>Seminar on Effective Research Practices &amp; Academic Culture</em>
</a>
<ul>
<li>Observations from teaching this course are summarized in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12650.pdf">Empowering First-Year Computer Science Ph.D. Students to Create a Culture that Values Community and Mental Health (Yacoby et al. 2023)</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Washington's <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590x/22wi/resources/"><em>Tao of PhD</em></a></li>
<li>Berkeley's <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs298-7/fa20/lectures/"><em>Research Culture And Community Norms</em></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keeping-up-with-the-field">Keeping up with the field</h2>
<h3 id="news">News</h3>
<p>Along with area-specific newsletters compiled for the various research niches in CS, these general resources can help you keep pace with research news.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html#subscribe-to-daily-listing-emails">arXiv daily listing emails</a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxivdigest.org/">arXivDigest</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/nathanlesage/academics-on-mastodon">Academics on Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are too many curated newsletters available to list here, but we recommend searching out the ones that are most relevant for your needs.</p>
<h3 id="rankings">Rankings</h3>
<p>Quantifying the impact of conferences, journals, and institutions is a fraught endeavor, but sometimes metrics can be a useful starting point when you are new to a field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Still getting to know the top venues in your research area? Google Scholar provides a <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng">ranking of publications by area</a>. These can be filtered by <em>subcategory</em>. This can be a reference point, but take these metrics with a grain of salt!</li>
<li>Likewise, <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&amp;us">CSRankings</a> provides metrics on institutions around the world by CS research area. Again, take these metrics with a grain of salt!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-a-personal-website">Creating a personal website</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/cis/cisweb/">How to host your website on Cornell's CS Department web servers</a></li>
<li>This will lead to the creation of your personal website under cs.cornell.edu/~username.
This username is different from your alphanumeric NetID and your numeric Cornell ID.
You should have received a username via IT during the summer before you matriculated. If you don't have one, contact Becky Stewart.</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is a very low-overhead option for freely hosting websites via GitHub repositories. We highly recommend this route if you want to quickly and simply launch a personal site. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-the-connection-between-ithaca-and-cornell-tech">Using the connection between Ithaca and Cornell Tech</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/current-students/travel-funding-opportunities">Inter-campus travel funding</a></li>
