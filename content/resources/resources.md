## The hidden curriculum

### Internal resources

Cornell Tech's Mor Naaman has drafted an excellent "[PhD Syllabus](https://s.tech.cornell.edu/phd-syllabus/)" for students working in his group. Your mileage may vary, but this syllabus provides great insights into the PhD process.

### External resources

Check out the extensive reading recommendations provided by PhD professionalization seminars at other computer science departments. These resources span a range of topics, including the advisor-advisee relationship; imposter syndrome; academic speaking, writing, and reading skills; and time management during the PhD.

## Creating a personal website

- [How to host your website on Cornell's CS Department web servers](https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/cis/cisweb/)
- This will lead to the creation of your personal website under cs.cornell.edu/~username.
This username is different from your alphanumeric NetID and your numeric Cornell ID.
You should have received a username via IT during the summer before you matriculated. If you don't have one, contact Becky Stewart.
