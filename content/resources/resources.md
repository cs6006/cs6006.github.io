## Working Environment

### IT Support

When you need IT support, contact the College of Engineering's ITSG and not the University-wide IT Support Desk. Do so by filing a ticket [here](https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/). This applies to both campuses.

### Facilities Support

When you need non-technical facilities support around campus, file a ticket with Facilities.
- Gates Hall or Rhodes Hall: file a ticket [here](https://tdx.cornell.edu/TDClient/171/Portal/Home/).
- A different building overseen by the College of Engineering: file a ticket [here](https://tdx.cornell.edu/TDClient/133/Portal/Home/).


## The hidden curriculum

### Internal resources

Cornell Tech's Mor Naaman has drafted an excellent "[PhD Syllabus](https://s.tech.cornell.edu/phd-syllabus/)" for students working in his group. Your mileage may vary, but this syllabus provides great insights into the PhD process.

### External resources

Check out the extensive reading recommendations provided by PhD professionalization seminars at other computer science departments. These resources span a range of topics, including the advisor-advisee relationship; imposter syndrome; academic speaking, writing, and reading skills; and time management during the PhD.

- Harvard's [_Seminar on Effective Research Practices & Academic Culture_
](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/readings/)

## Keeping up with the field

Along with area-specific newsletters compiled for the various research niches in CS, these general resources can help you keep pace with research news.

- [arXiv daily listing emails](https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html#subscribe-to-daily-listing-emails)
- [arXivDigest](https://arxivdigest.org/)
- [Google Scholar alerts](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/resources/subject-guides/keeping-current/creating-alerts-google-scholar)

## Creating a personal website

- [How to host your website on Cornell's CS Department web servers](https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/cis/cisweb/)
- This will lead to the creation of your personal website under cs.cornell.edu/~username.
This username is different from your alphanumeric NetID and your numeric Cornell ID.
You should have received a username via IT during the summer before you matriculated. If you don't have one, contact Becky Stewart.
