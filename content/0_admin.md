## You

First-year MS and PhD students in Computer Science.
59 students in Ithaca, and 4 at Cornell Tech.

Welcome to Cornell!

## Me

I'm a third-year PhD student. I'm advised by [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/).
My research is in programming languages, with applications to architecture, networking, and verification.

Outside of work, I care deeply about food.

## This course

This course is a venue to collate resources, share best practices, and talk about pain points together.

Graduate school is hard and long and all that, but it is also pretty _weird_.
A bunch of stuff will no doubt come up during your years here, and it's better to have a well-considered plan in mind than to listen to the first person who tells you what to do in a moment of crisis.

The course is in its very first iteration! I welcome your feedback, and I hope you'll help me make it better.

## Food

**Ithaca.** Available 11:45-12:20. No queues during talk.

**Tech.** Pick up beforehand at the cafe.

We are the largest fully-catered weekly event in the department!
Let's just try to not be a pain.
- Leftovers go to Gates's fourth floor kitchen and get announced on #vultures.
- Trash goes into the large bin; bags get tied off before they are full. Full bags, and the used bin, are moved somewhere? I actually don't know the best practice for this...
- I recommend buying a Lock&Lock style container for your food. It's a good investment!
