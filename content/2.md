This session approaches the hidden curriculum through a wellness lens. Our physical, mental, and financial wellness can impact our work/life balance and have significant consequences for our academic success and professional development.

## Internal resources

The following internal resources can help you stay informed of your rights, benefits, and pay at Cornell.

#### Employment rights and benefits

- Know your graduate student union: [Cornell Graduate Students United](https://cornellgradunion.org/)
- Know your vacation rights: [Vacation policy for Cornell graduate students](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/policies/vacation-time-for-assistantships/)

#### Healthcare

- Know your health benefits: [Student Health Benefits Enrollment & Coverage](https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/enrollment-coverage)
- [Mental Health Care at Cornell (Ithaca)](https://health.cornell.edu/services/mental-health-care)
- [Mental Health Care at Cornell Tech (NYC)](https://studentaffairs.tech.cornell.edu/health-wellness/nyc-health-resources/)

##### Getting healthcare in Ithaca

- Primary Care: [Cornell Health on Ho Plaza](https://health.cornell.edu/); call them on 607-255-5155 to make an appointment
- Urgent care, or care outside of Cornell Health's hours:
    - Standalone urgent care options such as [WellNow](https://www.wellnow.com/urgent-care-centers/new-york/ithaca/740-south-meadow-street-14850) (607-319-4563) will see you relatively quickly, but, in case you are a tricky case, may refer you to the option below.
    - The more challenging, but more complete, option is [Cayuga Health](https://cayugahealth.org/)'s ER. They have access to all the facilities of the hospital. However, prepare for long, long waits. Bring a book, a sweater, a phone charger, etc.
- Your primary care provider may refer you to [Cayuga Health](https://cayugahealth.org/) for advanced care. Don't be a hero: consider asking a friend for a ride, or booking a [Collegetown Cab](https://collegetowncab.com/).
- Vision: You can enroll in VSP vision insurance through Cornell. Enrollment is open for only a few months of the year. See [here](https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/dental-vision/vision-enrollment) for more.
- Dental: Similarly, you can enroll in Metlife dental insurance through Cornell. Again, this is open for only a few months of the year. See [here](https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/dental-vision/dental-enrollment) for more.


#### Finances

- Know your pay: [Cornell stipend rates](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/stipend-rates/)
- Know your tax information: [Graduate School Tax Information](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/financial-support/tax-information/)
- [Internal travel funding](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/current-students/travel-funding-opportunities)

#### IT Support

When you need IT support, contact the College of Engineering's ITSG and not the University-wide IT Support Desk. Do so by filing a ticket [here](https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/). This applies to both campuses.

#### Facilities Support

When physical things break around campus, especially in Gates Hall, file a ticket [here](https://tdx.cornell.edu/TDClient/133/Portal/Home/). This applies to the Ithaca campus.
